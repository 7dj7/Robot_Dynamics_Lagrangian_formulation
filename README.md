# Robot_Dynamics_Lagrangian_formulation
## Calculates the dynamic equations of motion of a N DOF robot arm using the Lagrangian formulation

### Description of files
'compute_dh_matrix.m' - function to calculate the homogeneous transformation matrix according to the DH Parameter <br>
'inertia_tensor.m' - function to initialize the inertia tensor with respect to the body fixed frame <br>
'complete_dynamics.m' - main script file to calculate the dynamic equations of motion (torqe/force equations)

### Notes
As an example, the dynamics of a 7 DOF robot arm called the Swayer Arm has been calculated. <br>
